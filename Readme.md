## Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders.

During my master's at TU Dortmund. I have worked as a Student Research Assistant under the chair of Data Science and Data Engineering (LS-9).
I collaborated with PhD students there on topics like detecting anomalies and finding objects in a logistic workplace.
In this repository, I posted some Python scripts and code snippets I created while working there.


## Tasks:

1. Using Autoencoders to re-identify the pallet blocks.
2. Object Detection: Objects present in the Logistic warehouses.
