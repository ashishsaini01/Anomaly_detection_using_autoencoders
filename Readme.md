## Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders.

During my master's at TU Dortmund. I have worked as a Student Research Assistant under the chair of Data Science and Data Engineering (LS-9).
There, I collaborated with PhD students on topics like Detecting anomalies and finding objects in a logistic workplace.
In this repository, I posted some Python scripts and code snippets I created while working there.


## Tasks:

1. Using Autoencoders for re-identifying the pallet blocks.
2. Object Detection: Objects present in the Logistic warehouses.
